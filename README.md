#Q
##Paving the way for inclusivity.
###Inspiration
####Our team consists of individuals in the BIPOC and LGBTQ+ communites and have been in cities, businesses, and events where we have felt uncomfortable because the atmosphere was not welcoming to our respective identities.
###Purpose
####We set out to create an app and community centered around inclusivity in social spaces for the LGBTQ+ and BIPOC communities.
###How we built it
####The front-end code for Q was developed in Xcode using Swift. The design was created using Figma. Back-end development was done with MongoDB.
###Challenges
####The biggest challenge for front end development was that this was my first time ever using Xcode or Swift. In fact it was my first time doing anything related to mobile application development. I used my knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript to quickly get the reins on Swift and did my best to learn on the go.
####I also lacked any experience with back-end development but was excited to get my feet wet in MongoDB. I wasn't able to have anything fuctional but was able to create a database and link it to my repository. With a little more time and some more learning, I'd love to use MongoDB for the search query, the "What's popular near you" and the "Event's happening now" sections of the app. I also envisoned using the service for user data (account infp, saved events/locations and notifications.
###Accomplishments
####The biggest accomplishment is about the same as the biggest challenge, creating something in a whole new language! I was quite proud of being able to create what I did with my limited experience and time. I faced a lot of challenges along the way but was able to overcome them all and get the results I was hoping for.
###What we learned
####Besides learning Swift, I also learned a good bit about MongoDB and using databases for an iOS app.
